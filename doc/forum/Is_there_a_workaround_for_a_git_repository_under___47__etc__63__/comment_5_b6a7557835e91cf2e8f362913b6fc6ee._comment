Your repo has already been added as a submodule. That's why git commit is
complaining about it.

If you put it in /etc/.gitignore before `etckeeper commit`,
it will be ignored from the beginning.

At this point you will need to remove the submodule as well as ignoring it.

I was a little surprised to see etckeeper adding git repos within /etc
as submodules, but it turns out that `git add --all` or `git add .` do add
submodules that way.

I did some research and found out that there is no good way to avoid etckeeper commit "daily autocommit" exiting with status code other than zero if there is a git repository under the /etc hierarchy? This causes the /etc/cron.daily/etckeeper to send an e-mail every day with body "run-parts: /etc/cron.daily/etckeeper exited with return code 1."

I've attempted to add the repo as git submodule in /etc/.gitmodules and tried to add "-path ./local -prune -o" to the NOVCS in /etc/etckeeper/pre-commit.d/30store-metadata but neither of these fixed the issue.

If I have a git repo in /etc/myrepo:

# etckeeper commit "daily autocommit"
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
  (commit or discard the untracked or modified content in submodules)
	modified:   myrepo (untracked content)

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
# echo $?
1

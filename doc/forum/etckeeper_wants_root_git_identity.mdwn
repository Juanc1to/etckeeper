I've installed etckeeper & git on a new machine running arch.  I've got sudo and git setup for my regular user.  When I `sudo etckeeper commit "Initial commit"` git gives me the usual message about empty ident name for root@host.  Documentation suggests that sudo will grab the ident of sudo user but that doesn't seem to be working.  I'm running etckeeper 1.18.12-1.  What am I missing?

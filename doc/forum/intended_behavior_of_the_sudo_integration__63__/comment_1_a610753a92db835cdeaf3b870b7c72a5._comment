When user.email is not set in the global git config, 
etckeeper sets `GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL` to

	`whoami`"@$hostname"

Where $hostname is `hostname` with `dnsdomainname` added as the domain if
that outputs anything.

It's possible etckeeper could be improved, but I don't have a sufficiently
broken system to see it fail, so patches or further analysis would be up to
you.

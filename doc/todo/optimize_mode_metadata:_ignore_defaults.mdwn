here's another idea: why do we store metadata for files that have "default" modes (as understood by git) like `0755` (for directories) or `0644` (for files)? This seems like a huge waste of time and something that grows the `.etckeeper` metadata file needlessly.

I believe the following patch would improve things quite a bit:

[[!format diff """
modified   pre-commit.d/30store-metadata
@@ -92,7 +92,9 @@ maybe_chmod_chown() {
 			if ($gid != $)) {
 				printf "maybe chgrp $q%s$q %s\n", gidname($gid), $_;
 			}
-			printf "maybe chmod %04o %s\n", $mode & 07777, $_;
+			if ($mode != 0100644 and $mode != 040755) {
+				printf "maybe chmod %04o %s\n", $mode & 07777, $_;

 		'
 		return $?
 	else

In my messy home server, this gives me that resulting diff:

[[!format txt """
root@marcos:/etc# git diff --cached --stat

 1 file changed, 10231 deletions(-)
"""]]

yes, you read that right, that's 10 *thousand* files cleaned up. and yes, it seems like i have over 20,000 files in /etc. yikes. (it's mostly because this is a puppet server and there's lots of git repos under there, and cache files. and yes, those are in the .gitignore and shouldn't even be in the `.etckeeper` file in the first place, but that's a different story, see [[todo/metadata_ignore_filters_do_not_work]].

so anyways, i figured that would be a worthwhile optimisation! :) --[[anarcat]]
